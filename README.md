# calculator
Will be creating a simple calculator using JS, HTML, and CSS. This calculator will consist of the digits 1-9, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, clear all, backspace, and modulus buttons. It will take 2 operands and an operator to complete the operations. All selected operands and operations will be displayed as well as the result.  

# Result
Finished creating the calculator. I used the calculator application on the Iphone as a reference for the style, added hover effects, and all computations are completely functional. The only diffrence between this version of the calculator and the Iphone is that it doesn't have the +/- button to change the value to negative. This can be added easily however, for this iteration I decided to not add its functionality. The calculator handles 0/0, 0/x, floating numbers, and large numbers alike. You can choose to continue computating on your result by pressing an operation after receiving a result or starting a new problem by entering a nubmer immedietly after a result is given.
